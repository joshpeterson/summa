# Of Vainglory

We must now consider vainglory: under which head there are five points of inquiry:
(1) Whether desire of glory is a sin?
(2) Whether it is opposed to magnanimity?
(3) Whether it is a mortal sin?
(4) Whether it is a capital vice?
(5) Of its daughters.

* Whether Vainglory Is A Mortal Sin?
* Whether Vainglory Is A Capital Vice?
* Whether The Daughters Of Vainglory Are Suitably Reckoned To Be Disobedience, Boastfulness, Hypocrisy, Contention, Obstinacy, Discord, And Love Of Novelties?
