# Of The Gift Of Fortitude

We must next consider the gift corresponding to fortitude, and this is the gift of fortitude. Under this head there are two points of inquiry:
(1) Whether fortitude is a gift?
(2) Which among the beatitudes and fruits correspond to it?

* Whether Fortitude Is A Gift?
* Whether The Fourth Beatitude: "Blessed Are They That Hunger And Thirst After Justice," Corresponds To The Gift Of Fortitude?
