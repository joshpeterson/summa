# Of Incontinence

We must now consider incontinence: and under this head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether incontinence pertains to the soul or to the body?
(2) Whether incontinence is a sin?
(3) The comparison between incontinence and intemperance;
(4) Which is the worse, incontinence in anger, or incontinence in desire?

* Whether Incontinence Pertains To The Soul Or To The Body?
* Whether Incontinence Is A Sin?
* Whether The Incontinent Man Sins More Gravely Than The Intemperate?
