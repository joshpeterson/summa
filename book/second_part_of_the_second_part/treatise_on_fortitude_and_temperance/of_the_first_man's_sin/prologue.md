# Of The First Man's Sin

We must now consider the first man's sin which was pride: and (1) his sin; (2) its punishment; (3) the temptation whereby he was led to sin.  Under the first head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether pride was the first man's first sin?
(2) What the first man coveted by sinning?
(3) Whether his sin was more grievous than all other sins?
(4) Which sinned more grievously, the man or the woman?

* Whether Pride Was The First Man's First Sin?
* Whether The First Man's Pride Consisted In His Coveting God's Likeness?
* Whether The Sin Of Our First Parents Was More Grievous Than Other Sins?
* Whether Adam's Sin Was More Grievous Than Eve's?
