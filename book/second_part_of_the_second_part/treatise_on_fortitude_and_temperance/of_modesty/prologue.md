# Of Modesty

We must now consider modesty: and (1) Modesty in general; (2) Each of its species. Under the first head there are two points of inquiry:
(1) Whether modesty is a part of temperance?
(2) What is the matter of modesty?

* Whether Modesty Is A Part Of Temperance?
* Whether Modesty Is Only About Outward Actions?
