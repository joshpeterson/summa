# Of Honesty

[*Honesty must be taken here in its broad sense as   synonymous with moral goodness, from the point of view of decorum.]  We must now consider honesty, under which head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) The relation between the honest and the virtuous;
(2) Its relation with the beautiful [*As honesty here denotes moral goodness, so beauty stands for moral beauty];
(3) Its relation with the useful and the pleasant;
(4) Whether honesty is a part of temperance?

* Whether Honesty Is The Same As Virtue?
* Whether The Honest Is The Same As The Beautiful?
* Whether The Honest Differs From The Useful And The Pleasant?
* Whether Honesty Should Be Reckoned A Part Of Temperance?
