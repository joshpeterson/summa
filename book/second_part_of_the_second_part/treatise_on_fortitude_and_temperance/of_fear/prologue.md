# Of Fear

[*St. Thomas calls this vice indifferently 'fear' or   'timidity.' The translation requires one to adhere to these terms on account   of the connection with the passion of fear. Otherwise 'cowardice' would be a   better rendering.]  We must now consider the vices opposed to fortitude: (1) Fear; (2) Fearlessness; (3) Daring.  Under the first head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether fear is a sin?
(2) Whether it is opposed to fortitude?
(3) Whether it is a mortal sin?
(4) Whether it excuses from sin, or diminishes it?
