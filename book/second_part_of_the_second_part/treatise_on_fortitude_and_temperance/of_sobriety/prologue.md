# Of Sobriety

We must now consider sobriety and the contrary vice, namely drunkenness. As regards sobriety there are four points of inquiry:
(1) What is the matter of sobriety?
(2) Whether it is a special virtue?
(3) Whether the use of wine is lawful?
(4) To whom especially is sobriety becoming?

* Whether Drink Is The Matter Of Sobriety?
* Whether Sobriety Is By Itself A Special Virtue?
* Whether The Use Of Wine Is Altogether Unlawful?
* Whether Sobriety Is More Requisite In Persons Of Greater Standing?
