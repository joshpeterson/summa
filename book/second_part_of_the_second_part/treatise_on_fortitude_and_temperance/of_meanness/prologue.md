# Of Meanness

[*"Parvificentia," or doing mean things, just as   "magnificentia" is doing great things.]  We must now consider the vices opposed to magnificence: under which head there are two points of inquiry:
(1) Whether meanness is a vice?
(2) Of the vice opposed to it.

* Whether Meanness Is A Vice?
* Whether There Is A Vice Opposed To Meanness?
