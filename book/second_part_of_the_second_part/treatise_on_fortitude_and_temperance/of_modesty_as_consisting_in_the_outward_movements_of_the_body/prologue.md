# Of Modesty As Consisting In The Outward Movements Of The Body

We must next consider modesty as consisting in the outward movements of the body, and under this head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether there can be virtue and vice in the outward movements of the body that are done seriously?
(2) Whether there can be a virtue about playful actions?
(3) Of the sin consisting in excess of play;
(4) Of the sin consisting in lack of play.

* Whether Any Virtue Regards The Outward Movements Of The Body?
* Whether There Can Be A Virtue About Games?
* Whether There Can Be Sin In The Excess Of Play?
* Whether There Is A Sin In Lack Of Mirth?
