We must next consider clemency and meekness, and the contrary vices. Concerning the virtues themselves there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether clemency and meekness are altogether identical?
(2) Whether each of them is a virtue?
(3) Whether each is a part of temperance?
(4) Of their comparison with the other virtues.

* Whether Both Clemency And Meekness Are Virtues?
* Whether The Aforesaid Virtues Are Parts Of Temperance?
