# Of Devotion

We must now consider the acts of religion. First, we shall consider the interior acts, which, as stated above, are its principal acts; secondly, we shall consider its exterior acts, which are secondary. The interior acts of religion are seemingly devotion and prayer. Accordingly we shall treat first of devotion, and afterwards of prayer.  Under the first head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether devotion is a special act?
(2) Whether it is an act of religion?
(3) Of the cause of devotion?
(4) Of its effect?

* Whether Devotion Is A Special Act?
* Whether Devotion Is An Act Of Religion?
* Whether Contemplation Or Meditation Is The Cause Of Devotion?
* Whether Joy Is An Effect Of Devotion?
