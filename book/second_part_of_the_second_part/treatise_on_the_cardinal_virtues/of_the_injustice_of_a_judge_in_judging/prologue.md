# Of The Injustice Of A Judge, In Judging

We must now consider those vices opposed to commutative justice, that consist in words injurious to our neighbors. We shall consider (1) those which are connected with judicial proceedings, and (2) injurious words uttered extra-judicially.  Under the first head five points occur for our consideration: (1) The injustice of a judge in judging; (2) The injustice of the prosecutor in accusing; (3) The injustice of the defendant in defending himself; (4) The injustice of the witnesses in giving evidence; (5) The injustice of the advocate in defending.  Under the first head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether a man can justly judge one who is not his subject?
(2) Whether it is lawful for a judge, on account of the evidence, to deliver judgment in opposition to the truth which is known to him?
(3) Whether a judge can justly sentence a man who is not accused?
(4) Whether he can justly remit the punishment?

* Whether A Man Can Justly Judge One Who Is Not Subject To His Jurisdiction?
* Whether It Is Lawful For A Judge To Pronounce Judgment Against The Truth That He Knows, On Account Of Evidence To The Contrary?
* Whether A Judge May Condemn A Man Who Is Not Accused?
* Whether The Judge Can Lawfully Remit The Punishment?
