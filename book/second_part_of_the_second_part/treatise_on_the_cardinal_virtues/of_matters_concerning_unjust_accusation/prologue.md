# Of Matters Concerning Unjust Accusation

We must now consider matters pertaining to unjust accusation. Under this head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether a man is bound to accuse?
(2) Whether the accusation should be made in writing?
(3) How is an accusation vitiated?
(4) How should those be punished who have accused a man wrongfully?

* Whether A Man Is Bound To Accuse?
* Whether It Is Necessary For The Accusation To Be Made In Writing?
* Whether An Accusation Is Rendered Unjust By Calumny, Collusion Or Evasion?
* Whether An Accuser Who Fails To Prove His Indictment Is Bound To The Punishment Of Retaliation?
