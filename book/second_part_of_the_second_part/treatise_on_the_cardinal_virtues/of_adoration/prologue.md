# Of Adoration

In due sequence we must consider the external acts of latria, and in the first place, adoration whereby one uses one's body to reverence God; secondly, those acts whereby some external thing is offered to God; thirdly, those acts whereby something belonging to God is assumed.  Under the first head there are three points of inquiry:
(1) Whether adoration is an act of latria?
(2) Whether adoration denotes an internal or an external act?
(3) Whether adoration requires a definite place?

* Whether Adoration Is An Act Of Latria Or Religion?
* Whether Adoration Denotes An Action Of The Body?
* Whether Adoration Requires A Definite Place?
