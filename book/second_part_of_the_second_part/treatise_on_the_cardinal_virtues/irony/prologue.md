# Irony

[*Irony here must be given the signification of the   Greek {eironia}, whence it is derived: dissimulation of one's own good   points.]  We must now consider irony, under which head there are two points of inquiry:
(1) Whether irony is a sin?
(2) Of its comparison with boasting.

* Whether Irony Is A Sin?
* Whether Irony Is A Less Grievous Sin Than Boasting?
