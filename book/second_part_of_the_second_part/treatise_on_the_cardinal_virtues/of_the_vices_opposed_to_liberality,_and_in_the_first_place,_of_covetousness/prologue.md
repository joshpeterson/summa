# Of The Vices Opposed To Liberality, And In The First Place, Of Covetousness

We must now consider the vices opposed to liberality: and (1) covetousness; (2) prodigality.  Under the first head there are eight points of inquiry:
(1) Whether covetousness is a sin?
(2) Whether it is a special sin?
(3) To which virtue it is opposed;
(4) Whether it is a mortal sin?
(5) Whether it is the most grievous of sins?
(6) Whether it is a sin of the flesh or a spiritual sin?
(7) Whether it is a capital vice?
(8) Of its daughters.
