We must now consider quarreling; concerning which there are two points of inquiry:
(1) Whether it is opposed to the virtue of friendship?
(2) Of its comparison with flattery?

* Whether Quarreling Is Opposed To The Virtue Of Friendship Or Affability?
* Whether Quarreling Is A More Grievous Sin Than Flattery?
