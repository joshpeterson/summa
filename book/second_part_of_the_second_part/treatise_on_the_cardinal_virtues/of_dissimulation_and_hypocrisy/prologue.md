In due sequence we must consider dissimulation and hypocrisy. Under this head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether all dissimulation is a sin?
(2) Whether hypocrisy is dissimulation?
(3) Whether it is opposed to truth?
(4) Whether it is a mortal sin?

* Whether All Dissimulation Is A Sin?
* Whether Hypocrisy Is The Same As Dissimulation?
