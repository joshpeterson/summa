# Of Injustice With Regard To The Person Of The Witness

We must now consider injustice with regard to the person of the witness. Under this head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether a man is bound to give evidence?
(2) Whether the evidence of two or three witnesses suffices?
(3) Whether a man's evidence may be rejected without any fault on his part?
(4) Whether it is a mortal sin to bear false witness?

* Whether A Man Is Bound To Give Evidence?
* Whether The Evidence Of Two Or Three Persons Suffices?
* Whether A Man's Evidence Can Be Rejected Without Any Fault Of His?
* Whether It Is Always A Mortal Sin To Give False Evidence?
