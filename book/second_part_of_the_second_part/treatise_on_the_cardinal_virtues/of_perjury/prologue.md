# Of Perjury

We must now consider perjury: under which head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether falsehood is necessary for perjury?
(2) Whether perjury is always a sin?
(3) Whether it is always a mortal sin?
(4) Whether it is a sin to enjoin an oath on a perjurer?

* Whether It Is Necessary For Perjury That The Statement Confirmed On Oath Be False?
* Whether All Perjury Is Sinful?
* Whether All Perjury Is A Mortal Sin?
* Whether He Sins Who Demands An Oath Of A Perjurer?
