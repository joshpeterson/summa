# Of Sacrilege

We must now consider the vices which pertain to irreligion, whereby sacred things are treated with irreverence. We shall consider (1) Sacrilege; (2) Simony.  Under the first head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) What is sacrilege?
(2) Whether it is a special sin?
(3) Of the species of sacrilege;
(4) Of the punishment of sacrilege.

* Whether Sacrilege Is The Violation Of A Sacred Thing?
* Whether Sacrilege Is A Special Sin?
* Whether The Species Of Sacrilege Are Distinguished According To The Sacred Things?
* Whether The Punishment Of Sacrilege Should Be Pecuniary?
