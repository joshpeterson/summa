# Of Oblations And First-fruits

We must next consider oblations and first-fruits. Under this head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether any oblations are necessary as a matter of precept?
(2) To whom are oblations due?
(3) of what things they should be made?
(4) In particular, as to first-fruits, whether men are bound to offer them?

* Whether Men Are Under A Necessity Of Precept To Make Oblations?
* Whether Oblations Are Due To Priests Alone?
* Whether A Man May Make Oblations Of Whatever He Lawfully Possesses?
* Whether Men Are Bound To Pay First-fruits?
