# On Simony

We must now consider simony, under which head there are six points of inquiry:
(1) What is simony?
(2) Whether it is lawful to accept money for the sacraments?
(3) Whether it is lawful to accept money for spiritual actions?
(4) Whether it is lawful to sell things connected with spirituals?
(5) Whether real remuneration alone makes a man guilty of simony, or also oral remuneration or remuneration by service?
(6) Of the punishment of simony.

* Whether Simony Is An Intentional Will To Buy Or Sell Something Spiritual Or Connected With A Spiritual Thing?
* Whether It Is Always Unlawful To Give Money For The Sacraments?
* Whether It Is Lawful To Give And Receive Money For Spiritual Actions?
* Whether It Is Lawful To Receive Money For Things Annexed To Spiritual Things?
* Whether It Is Lawful To Grant Spiritual Things In Return For An Equivalent Of Service, Or For An Oral Remuneration?
* Whether Those Who Are Guilty Of Simony Are Fittingly Punished By Being Deprived Of What They Have Acquired By Simony?
