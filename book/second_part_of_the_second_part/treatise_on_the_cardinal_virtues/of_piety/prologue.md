# Of Piety

We must now consider the gift that corresponds to justice; namely, piety. Under this head there are two points of inquiry:
(1) Whether it is a gift of the Holy Ghost?
(2) Which of the beatitudes and fruits corresponds to it?

* Whether Piety Is A Gift?
* Whether The Second Beatitude, "Blessed Are The Meek," Corresponds To The Gift Of Piety?
