# Of Injustice

We must now consider injustice, under which head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether injustice is a special vice?
(2) Whether it is proper to the unjust man to do unjust deeds?
(3) Whether one can suffer injustice willingly?
(4) Whether injustice is a mortal sin according to its genus?

* Whether Injustice Is A Special Virtue?
* Whether A Man Is Called Unjust Through Doing An Unjust Thing?
* Whether We Can Suffer Injustice Willingly?
* Whether Whoever Does An Injustice Sins Mortally?
