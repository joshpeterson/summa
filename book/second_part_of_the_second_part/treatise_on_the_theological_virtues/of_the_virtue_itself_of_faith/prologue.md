# Of The Virtue Itself Of Faith

We must now consider the virtue itself of faith, and, in the first place, faith itself; secondly, those who have faith; thirdly, the cause of faith; fourthly, its effects.  Under the first head there are eight points of inquiry:
(1) What is faith?
(2) In what power of the soul does it reside?
(3) Whether its form is charity?
(4) Whether living [formata] faith and lifeless [informis] faith are one identically?
(5) Whether faith is a virtue?
(6) Whether it is one virtue?
(7) Of its relation to the other virtues;
(8) Of its certitude as compared with the certitude of the intellectual virtues.

* Whether This Is A Fitting Definition Of Faith: "Faith Is The Substance Of Things To Be Hoped For, The Evidence Of Things That Appear Not?"
* Whether Faith Resides In The Intellect?
* Whether Charity Is The Form Of Faith?
* Whether Lifeless Faith Can Become Living, Or Living Faith, Lifeless?
* Whether Faith Is A Virtue?
* Whether Faith Is One Virtue?
* Whether Faith Is The First Of The Virtues?
* Whether Faith Is More Certain Than Science And The Other Intellectual Virtues?
