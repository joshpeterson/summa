# Of Presumption

We must now consider presumption, under which head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) What is the object in which presumption trusts?
(2) Whether presumption is a sin?
(3) To what is it opposed?
(4) From what vice does it arise?

* Whether Presumption Trusts In God Or In Our Own Power?
* Whether Presumption Is A Sin?
* Whether Presumption Is More Opposed To Fear Than To Hope?
* Whether Presumption Arises From Vainglory?
