# Of Sloth

We must now consider the vices opposed to the joy of charity. This joy is either about the Divine good, and then its contrary is sloth, or about our neighbor's good, and then its contrary is envy. Wherefore we must consider (1) Sloth and (2) Envy.  Under the first head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether sloth is a sin?
(2) Whether it is a special vice?
(3) Whether it is a mortal sin?
(4) Whether it is a capital sin?

* Whether Sloth Is A Sin?
* Whether Sloth Is A Special Vice?
* Whether Sloth Is A Mortal Sin?
* Whether Sloth Should Be Accounted A Capital Vice?
