# Of The Subject Of Hope

We must now consider the subject of hope, under which head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether the virtue of hope is in the will as its subject?
(2) Whether it is in the blessed?
(3) Whether it is in the damned?
(4) Whether there is certainty in the hope of the wayfarer?

* Whether Hope Is In The Will As Its Subject?
* Whether In The Blessed There Is Hope?
* Whether Hope Is In The Damned?
* Whether There Is Certainty In The Hope Of A Wayfarer?
