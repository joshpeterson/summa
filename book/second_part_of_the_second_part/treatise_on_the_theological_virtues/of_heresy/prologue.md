# Of Heresy

We must now consider heresy: under which head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether heresy is a kind of unbelief?
(2) Of the matter about which it is;
(3) Whether heretics should be tolerated?
(4) Whether converts should be received?

* Whether Heresy Is A Species Of Unbelief?
* Whether Heresy Is Properly About Matters Of Faith?
* Whether Heretics Ought To Be Tolerated?
* Whether The Church Should Receive Those Who Return From Heresy?
