# Of Mercy

[*The one Latin word "misericordia" signifies either   pity or mercy. The distinction between these two is that pity may stand either   for the act or for the virtue, whereas mercy stands only for the virtue.]  We must now go on to consider Mercy, under which head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether evil is the cause of mercy on the part of the person pitied?
(2) To whom does it belong to pity?
(3) Whether mercy is a virtue?
(4) Whether it is the greatest of virtues?
