# Of The Gift Of Wisdom

We must now consider the gift of wisdom which corresponds to charity; and firstly, wisdom itself, secondly, the opposite vice. Under the first head there are six points of inquiry:
(1) Whether wisdom should be reckoned among the gifts of the Holy Ghost?
(2) What is its subject?
(3) Whether wisdom is only speculative or also practical?
(4) Whether the wisdom that is a gift is compatible with mortal sin?
(5) Whether it is in all those who have sanctifying grace?
(6) Which beatitude corresponds to it?

* Whether Wisdom Should Be Reckoned Among The Gifts Of The Holy Ghost?
* Whether Wisdom Is In The Intellect As Its Subject?
* Whether Wisdom Is Merely Speculative, Or Practical Also?
* Whether Wisdom Can Be Without Grace, And With Mortal Sin?
* Whether Wisdom Is In All Who Have Grace?
* Whether The Seventh Beatitude Corresponds To The Gift Of Wisdom?
