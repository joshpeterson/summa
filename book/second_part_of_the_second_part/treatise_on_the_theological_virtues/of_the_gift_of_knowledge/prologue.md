# Of The Gift Of Knowledge

We must now consider the gift of knowledge, under which head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether knowledge is a gift?
(2) Whether it is about Divine things?
(3) Whether it is speculative or practical?
(4) Which beatitude responds to it?

* Whether Knowledge Is A Gift?
* Whether The Gift Of Knowledge Is About Divine Things?
* Whether The Gift Of Knowledge Is Practical Knowledge?
* Whether The Third Beatitude, "Blessed Are They That Mourn," Etc. Corresponds To The Gift Of Knowledge?
