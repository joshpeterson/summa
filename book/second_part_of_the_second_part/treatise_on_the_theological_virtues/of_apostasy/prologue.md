# Of Apostasy

We must now consider apostasy: about which there are two points of inquiry:
(1) Whether apostasy pertains to unbelief?
(2) Whether, on account of apostasy from the faith, subjects are absolved from allegiance to an apostate prince?

* Whether Apostasy Pertains To Unbelief?
* Whether A Prince Forfeits His Dominion Over His Subjects, On Account Of Apostasy From The Faith, So That They No Longer Owe Him Allegiance?
