# Of The Division Of Prophecy

We must now consider the division of prophecy, and under this head there are six points of inquiry:
(1) The division of prophecy into its species;
(2) Whether the more excellent prophecy is that which is without imaginative vision?
(3) The various degrees of prophecy;
(4) Whether Moses was the greatest of the prophets?
(5) Whether a comprehensor can be a prophet?
(6) Whether prophecy advanced in perfection as time went on?

* Whether Prophecy Is Fittingly Divided Into The Prophecy Of Divine Predestination, Of Foreknowledge, And Of Denunciation?
* Whether The Prophecy Which Is Accompanied By Intellective And Imaginative Vision Is More Excellent Than That Which Is Accompanied By Intellective Vision Alone?
* Whether The Degrees Of Prophecy Can Be Distinguished According To The Imaginary Vision?
* Whether Moses Was The Greatest Of The Prophets?
* Whether There Is A Degree Of Prophecy In The Blessed?
* Whether The Degrees Of Prophecy Change As Time Goes On?
