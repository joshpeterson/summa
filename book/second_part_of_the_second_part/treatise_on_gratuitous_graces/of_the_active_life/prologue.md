# Of The Active Life

We must now consider the active life, under which head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether all the works of the moral virtues pertain to the active life?
(2) Whether prudence pertains to the active life?
(3) Whether teaching pertains to the active life?
(4) Of the duration of the active life.

* Whether All The Actions Of The Moral Virtues Pertain To The Active Life?
* Whether Prudence Pertains To The Active Life?
* Whether Teaching Is A Work Of The Active Or Of The Contemplative Life?
* Whether The Active Life Remains After This Life?
