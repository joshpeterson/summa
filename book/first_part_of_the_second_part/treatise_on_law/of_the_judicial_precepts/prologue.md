# Of The Judicial Precepts

We must now consider the judicial precepts: and first of all we shall consider them in general; in the second place we shall consider their reasons. Under the first head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) What is meant by the judicial precepts?
(2) Whether they are figurative?
(3) Their duration;
(4) Their division.

* Whether The Judicial Precepts Were Figurative?
* Whether The Judicial Precepts Of The Old Law Bind For Ever?
* Whether It Is Possible To Assign A Distinct Division Of The Judicial Precepts?
