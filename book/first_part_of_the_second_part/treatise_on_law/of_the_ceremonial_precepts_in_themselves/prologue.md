# Of The Ceremonial Precepts In Themselves

We must now consider the ceremonial precepts: and first we must consider them in themselves; secondly, their cause; thirdly, their duration. Under the first head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) The nature of the ceremonial precepts;
(2) Whether they are figurative?
(3) Whether there should have been many of them?
(4) Of their various kinds.

* Whether The Nature Of The Ceremonial Precepts Consists In Their Pertaining To The Worship Of God?
* Whether The Ceremonial Precepts Are Figurative?
* Whether There Should Have Been Man Ceremonial Precepts?
* Whether The Ceremonies Of The Old Law Are Suitably Divided Into Sacrifices, Sacred Things, Sacraments, And Observances?
