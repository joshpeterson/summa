# Of The Natural Law

We must now consider the natural law; concerning which there are six points of inquiry:
(1) What is the natural law?
(2) What are the precepts of the natural law?
(3) Whether all acts of virtue are prescribed by the natural law?
(4) Whether the natural law is the same in all?
(5) Whether it is changeable?
(6) Whether it can be abolished from the heart of man?

* Whether The Natural Law Is A Habit?
* Whether The Natural Law Contains Several Precepts, Or Only One?
* Whether All Acts Of Virtue Are Prescribed By The Natural Law?
* Whether The Natural Law Is The Same In All Men?
* Whether The Natural Law Can Be Changed?
