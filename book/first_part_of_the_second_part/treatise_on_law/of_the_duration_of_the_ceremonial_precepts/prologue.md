# Of The Duration Of The Ceremonial Precepts

We must now consider the duration of the ceremonial precepts: under which head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether the ceremonial precepts were in existence before the Law?
(2) Whether at the time of the Law the ceremonies of the Old Law had any power of justification?
(3) Whether they ceased at the coming of Christ?
(4) Whether it is a mortal sin to observe them after the coming of Christ?

* Whether The Ceremonies Of The Law Were In Existence Before The Law?
* Whether, At The Time Of The Law, The Ceremonies Of The Old Law Had Any Power Of Justification?
* Whether The Ceremonies Of The Old Law Ceased At The Coming Of Christ?
* Whether Since Christ's Passion The Legal Ceremonies Can Be Observed Without Committing Mortal Sin?
