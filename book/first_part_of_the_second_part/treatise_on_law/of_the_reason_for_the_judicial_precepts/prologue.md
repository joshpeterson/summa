# Of The Reason For The Judicial Precepts

We must now consider the reason for the judicial precepts: under which head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Concerning the reason for the judicial precepts relating to the rulers;
(2) Concerning the fellowship of one man with another;
(3) Concerning matters relating to foreigners;
(4) Concerning things relating to domestic matters.

* Whether The Old Law Enjoined Fitting Precepts Concerning Rulers?
* Whether The Judicial Precepts Were Suitably Framed As To The Relations Of One Man With Another?
* Whether The Judicial Precepts Regarding Foreigners Were Framed In A Suitable Manner?
* Whether The Old Law Set Forth Suitable Precepts About The Members Of The Household?
