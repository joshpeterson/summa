# Of The Law Of The Gospel, Called The New Law, Considered In Itself

In proper sequence we have to consider now the Law of the Gospel which is called the New Law: and in the first place we must consider it in itself; secondly, in comparison with the Old Law; thirdly, we shall treat of those things that are contained in the New Law. Under the first head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) What kind of law is it? i.e. Is it a written law or is it instilled in the heart?
(2) Of its efficacy, i.e. does it justify?
(3) Of its beginning: should it have been given at the beginning of the world?
(4) Of its end: i.e. whether it will last until the end, or will another law take its place?

* Whether The New Law Is A Written Law?
* Whether The New Law Justifies?
* Whether The New Law Should Have Been Given From The Beginning Of The World?
* Whether The New Law Will Last Till The End Of The World?
