# Of The Causes Of The Ceremonial Precepts

We must now consider the causes of the ceremonial precepts: under which head there are six points of inquiry:
(1) Whether there was any cause for the ceremonial precepts?
(2) Whether the cause of the ceremonial precepts was literal or figurative?
(3) The causes of the sacrifices;
(4) The causes of the sacrifices;
(5) The causes of the sacred things;
(6) The causes of the observances.

* Whether There Was Any Cause For The Ceremonial Precepts?

* Whether A Suitable Cause Can Be Assigned For The Ceremonies Which Pertained To Sacrifices?
* Whether Sufficient Reason Can Be Assigned For The Ceremonies Pertaining To Holy Things?
* Whether There Can Be Any Suitable Cause For The Sacraments Of The Old Law?
* Whether There Was Any Reasonable Cause For The Ceremonial Observances?
