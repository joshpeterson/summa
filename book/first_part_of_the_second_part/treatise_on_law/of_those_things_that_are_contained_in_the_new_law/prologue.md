# Of Those Things That Are Contained In The New Law

We must now consider those things that are contained in the New Law: under which head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether the New Law ought to prescribe or to forbid any outward works?
(2) Whether the New Law makes sufficient provision in prescribing and forbidding external acts?
(3) Whether in the matter of internal acts it directs man sufficiently?
(4) Whether it fittingly adds counsels to precepts?

* Whether The New Law Made Sufficient Ordinations About External Acts?
* Whether The New Law Directed Man Sufficiently As Regards Interior Actions?
* Whether Certain Definite Counsels Are Fittingly Proposed In The New Law?
