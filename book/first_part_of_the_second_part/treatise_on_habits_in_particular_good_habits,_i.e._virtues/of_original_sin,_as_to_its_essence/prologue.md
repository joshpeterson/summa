# Of Original Sin, As To Its Essence

We must now consider original sin as to its essence, and under this head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether original sin is a habit?
(2) Whether there is but one original sin in each man?
(3) Whether original sin is concupiscence?
(4) Whether original sin is equally in all?

* Whether Original Sin Is A Habit?
* Whether There Are Several Original Sins In One Man?
* Whether Original Sin Is Concupiscence?
* Whether Original Sin Is Equally In All?
