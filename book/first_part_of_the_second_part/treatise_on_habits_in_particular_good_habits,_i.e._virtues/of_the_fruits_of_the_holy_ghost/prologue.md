# Of The Fruits Of The Holy Ghost

We must now consider the Fruits of the Holy Ghost: under which head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether the fruits of the Holy Ghost are acts?
(2) Whether they differ from the beatitudes?
(3) Of their number?
(4) Of their opposition to the works of the flesh.

* Whether The Fruits Of The Holy Ghost Which The Apostle Enumerates Are Acts?
* Whether The Fruits Differ From The Beatitudes?
* Whether The Fruits Are Suitably Enumerated By The Apostle?
* Whether The Fruits Of The Holy Ghost Are Contrary To The Works Of The Flesh?
