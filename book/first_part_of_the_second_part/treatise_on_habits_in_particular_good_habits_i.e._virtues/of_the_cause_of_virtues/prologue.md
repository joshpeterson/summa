# Of The Cause Of Virtues

We must now consider the cause of virtues; and under this head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether virtue is in us by nature?
(2) Whether any virtue is caused in us by habituation?
(3) Whether any moral virtues are in us by infusion?
(4) Whether virtue acquired by habituation, is of the same species as infused virtue?

* Whether Virtue Is In Us By Nature?
* Whether Any Virtue Is Caused In Us By Habituation?
* Whether Any Moral Virtues Are In Us By Infusion?
* Whether Virtue By Habituation Belongs To The Same Species As Infused Virtue?
