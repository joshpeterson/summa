# Of That Cause Of Sin Which Is Malice

We must now consider the cause of sin on the part of the will, viz. malice: and under this head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether it is possible for anyone to sin through certain malice, i.e. purposely?
(2) Whether everyone that sins through habit, sins through certain malice?
(3) Whether every one that sins through certain malice, sins through habit?
(4) Whether it is more grievous to sin through certain malice, than through passion?

* Whether Anyone Sins Through Certain Malice?
* Whether Everyone That Sins Through Habit, Sins Through Certain Malice?
* Whether One Who Sins Through Certain Malice, Sins Through Habit?
* Whether It Is More Grievous To Sin Through Certain Malice Than Through Passion?
