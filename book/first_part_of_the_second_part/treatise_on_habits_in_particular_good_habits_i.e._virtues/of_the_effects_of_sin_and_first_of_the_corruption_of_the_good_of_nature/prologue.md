# Of The Effects Of Sin, And, First, Of The Corruption Of The Good Of Nature

We must now consider the effects of sin; and (1) the corruption of the good of nature; (2) the stain on the soul; (3) the debt of punishment.  Under the first head there are six points of inquiry:
(1) Whether the good of nature is diminished by sin?
(2) Whether it can be taken away altogether?
(3) Of the four wounds, mentioned by Bede, with which human nature is stricken in consequence of sin.
(4) Whether privation of mode, species and order is an effect of sin?
(5) Whether death and other bodily defects are the result of sin?
(6) Whether they are, in any way, natural to man?

* Whether Sin Diminishes The Good Of Nature?
* Whether The Entire Good Of Human Nature Can Be Destroyed By Sin?
* Whether Weakness, Ignorance, Malice And Concupiscence Are Suitably Reckoned As The Wounds Of Nature Consequent Upon Sin?
* Whether Privation Of Mode, Species And Order Is The Effect Of Sin?
* Whether Death And Other Bodily Defects Are The Result Of Sin?
* Whether Death And Other Defects Are Natural To Man?
