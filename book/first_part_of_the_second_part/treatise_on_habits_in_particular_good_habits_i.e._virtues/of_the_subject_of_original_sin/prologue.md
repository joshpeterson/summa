# Of The Subject Of Original Sin

We must now consider the subject of original sin, under which head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether the subject of original sin is the flesh rather than the soul?
(2) If it be the soul, whether this be through its essence, or through its powers?
(3) Whether the will prior to the other powers is the subject of original sin?
(4) Whether certain powers of the soul are specially infected, viz. the generative power, the concupiscible part, and the sense of touch?

* Whether Original Sin Is More In The Flesh Than In The Soul?
* Whether Original Sin Is In The Essence Of The Soul Rather Than In The Powers?
* Whether Original Sin Infects The Will Before The Other Powers?
* Whether The Aforesaid Powers Are More Infected Than The Others?
