# Of The Cause Of Sin, In Respect Of One Sin Being The Cause Of Another

We must now consider the cause of sin, in so far as one sin can be the cause of another. Under this head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether covetousness is the root of all sins?
(2) Whether pride is the beginning of every sin?
(3) Whether other special sins should be called capital vices, besides pride and covetousness?
(4) How many capital vices there are, and which are they?

* Whether Covetousness Is The Root Of All Sins?
* Whether Pride Is The Beginning Of Every Sin?
* Whether Any Other Special Sins, Besides Pride And Avarice, Should Be Called Capital?
* Whether The Seven Capital Vices Are Suitably Reckoned?
