# Of The Subject Of The Soul's Passions

We must now consider the passions of the soul: first, in general; secondly, in particular. Taking them in general, there are four things to be considered: (1) Their subject: (2) The difference between them: (3) Their mutual relationship: (4) Their malice and goodness.  Under the first head there are three points of inquiry:
(1) Whether there is any passion in the soul?
(2) Whether passion is in the appetitive rather than in the apprehensive part?
(3) Whether passion is in the sensitive appetite rather than in the intellectual appetite, which is called the will?

* Whether Any Passion Is In The Soul?
* Whether Passion Is In The Appetitive Rather Than In The Apprehensive Part?
* Whether Passion Is In The Sensitive Appetite Rather Than In The Intellectual Appetite, Which Is Called The Will?
