# How The Passions Differ From One Another

We must now consider how the passions differ from one another: and under this head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether the passions of the concupiscible part are different from those of the irascible part?
(2) Whether the contrariety of passions in the irascible part is based on the contrariety of good and evil?
(3) Whether there is any passion that has no contrary?
(4) Whether, in the same power, there are any passions, differing in species, but not contrary to one another?

* Whether The Contrariety Of The Irascible Passions Is Based On The Contrariety Of Good And Evil?
* Whether Any Passion Of The Soul Has No Contrariety?
* Whether In The Same Power, There Are Any Passions, Specifically Different, But Not Contrary To One Another?
