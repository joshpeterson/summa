# Of The Goodness And Malice Of Pleasures

We must now consider the goodness and malice of pleasures: under which head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether every pleasure is evil?
(2) If not, whether every pleasure is good?
(3) Whether any pleasure is the greatest good?
(4) Whether pleasure is the measure or rule by which to judge of moral good and evil?

* Whether Any Pleasure Is The Greatest Good?
* Whether Pleasure Is The Measure Or Rule By Which To Judge Of Moral Good Or Evil?
