# Of The Cause That Provokes Anger, And Of The Remedies Of Anger .]

[*There is no further mention of these remedies in the text, except in A[4].]  We must now consider the cause that provokes anger, and its remedies. Under this head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether the motive of anger is always something done against the one who is angry?
(2) Whether slight or contempt is the sole motive of anger?
(3) Of the cause of anger on the part of the angry person;
(4) Of the cause of anger on the part of the person with whom one is angry.

* Whether The Motive Of Anger Is Always Something Done Against The One Who Is Angry?
* Whether The Sole Motive Of Anger Is Slight Or Contempt?
* Whether A Man's Excellence Is The Cause Of His Being Angry?
* Whether A Person's Defect Is A Reason For Being More Easily Angry With Him?
