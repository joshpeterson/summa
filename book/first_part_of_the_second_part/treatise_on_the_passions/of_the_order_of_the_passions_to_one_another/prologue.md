# Of The Order Of The Passions To One Another

We must now consider the order of the passions to one another: and under this head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) The relation of the irascible passions to the concupiscible passions;
(2) The relation of the concupiscible passions to one another;
(3) The relation of the irascible passions to one another;
(4) The four principal passions.

* Whether The Irascible Passions Precede The Concupiscible Passions, Or Vice Versa?
* Whether Love Is The First Of The Concupiscible Passions?
* Whether Hope Is The First Of The Irascible Passions?
* Whether These Are The Four Principal Passions: Joy, Sadness, Hope And Fear?
