# Of The Cause Of Grace

We must now consider the cause of grace; and under this head there are five points of inquiry:
(1) Whether God alone is the efficient cause of grace?
(2) Whether any disposition towards grace is needed on the part of the recipient, by an act of free-will?
(3) Whether such a disposition can make grace follow of necessity?
(4) Whether grace is equal in all?
(5) Whether anyone may know that he has grace?

* Whether God Alone Is The Cause Of Grace?
* Whether Any Preparation And Disposition For Grace Is Required On Man's Part?
* Whether Grace Is Necessarily Given To Whoever Prepares Himself For It, Or To Whoever Does What He Can?
* Whether Grace Is Greater In One Than In Another?
* Whether Man Can Know That He Has Grace?
