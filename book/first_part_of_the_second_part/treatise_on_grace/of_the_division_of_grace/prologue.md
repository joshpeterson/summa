# Of The Division Of Grace

We must now consider the division of grace; under which head there are five points of inquiry:
(1) Whether grace is fittingly divided into gratuitous grace and sanctifying grace?
(2) Of the division into operating and cooperating grace;
(3) Of the division of it into prevenient and subsequent grace;
(4) Of the division of gratuitous grace;
(5) Of the comparison between sanctifying and gratuitous grace.

* Whether Grace Is Fittingly Divided Into Sanctifying Grace And Gratuitous Grace?
* Whether Grace Is Fittingly Divided Into Operating And Cooperating Grace?
* Whether Grace Is Fittingly Divided Into Prevenient And Subsequent Grace?
* Whether Gratuitous Grace Is Rightly Divided By The Apostle?
* Whether Gratuitous Grace Is Nobler Than Sanctifying Grace?
