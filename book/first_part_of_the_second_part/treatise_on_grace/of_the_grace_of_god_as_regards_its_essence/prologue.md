# Of The Grace Of God As Regards Its Essence

We must now consider the grace of God as regards its essence; and under this head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether grace implies something in the soul?
(2) Whether grace is a quality?
(3) Whether grace differs from infused virtue?
(4) Of the subject of grace.

* Whether Grace Implies Anything In The Soul?
* Whether Grace Is A Quality Of The Soul?
* Whether Grace Is The Same As Virtue?
* Whether Grace Is In The Essence Of The Soul As In A Subject, Or In One Of The Powers?
