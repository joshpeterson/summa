# Of The Circumstances Of Human Acts

We must now consider the circumstances of human acts: under which head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) What is a circumstance?
(2) Whether a theologian should take note of the circumstances of human acts?
(3) How many circumstances are there?
(4) Which are the most important of them?

* Whether A Circumstance Is An Accident Of A Human Act?
* Whether Theologians Should Take Note Of The Circumstances Of Human Acts?
* Whether The Circumstances Are Properly Set Forth In The Third Book Of Ethics?
* Whether The Most Important Circumstances Are "Why" And "In What The Act Consists"?
