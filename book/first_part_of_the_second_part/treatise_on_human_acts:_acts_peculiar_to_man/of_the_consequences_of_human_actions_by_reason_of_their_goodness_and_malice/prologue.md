# Of The Consequences Of Human Actions By Reason Of Their Goodness And Malice

We have now to consider the consequences of human actions by reason of their goodness and malice: and under this head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether a human action is right or sinful by reason of its being good or evil?
(2) Whether it thereby deserves praise or blame?
(3) Whether accordingly, it is meritorious or demeritorious?
(4) Whether it is accordingly meritorious or demeritorious before God?

* Whether A Human Action Is Right Or Sinful, In So Far As It Is Good Or Evil?
* Whether A Human Action Deserves Praise Or Blame, By Reason Of Its Being Good Or Evil?
* Whether A Human Action Is Meritorious Or Demeritorious In So Far As It Is Good Or Evil?
* Whether A Human Action Is Meritorious Or Demeritorious Before God, According As It Is Good Or Evil?
