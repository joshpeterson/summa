# Of The Subtlety Of The Bodies Of The Blessed

We must now consider the subtlety of the bodies of the blessed. Under this head there are six points of inquiry:
(1) Whether subtlety is a property of the glorified body?
(2) Whether by reason of this subtlety it can be in the same place with another not glorified body?
(3) Whether by a miracle two bodies can be in the same place?
(4) Whether a glorified body can be in the same place with another glorified body?
(5) Whether a glorified body necessarily requires a place equal to itself?
(6) Whether a glorified body is palpable?

* Whether Subtlety Is A Property Of The Glorified Body?
* Whether By Reason Of This Subtlety A Glorified Body Is Able To Be In The Same Place With Another Body Not Glorified?
* Whether It Is Possible, By A Miracle, For Two Bodies To Be In The Same Place?
* Whether One Glorified Body Can Be In The Same Place Together With Another Glorified Body?
* Whether By Virtue Of Its Subtlety A Glorified Body Will No Longer Need To Be In An Equal Place?
* Whether The Glorified Body, By Reason Of Its Subtlety, Will Be Impalpable?
