# Of The Impassibility Of The Bodies Of The Blessed After Their Resurrection

We must now consider the conditions under which the blessed rise again, and (1) the impassibility of their bodies; (2) their subtlety; (3) their agility; (4) their clarity. Under the first head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether the bodies of the saints will be impassible after the resurrection?
(2) Whether all will be equally impassible?
(3) Whether this impassibility renders the glorious bodies?
(4) Whether in them all the senses are in act?

* Whether All Will Be Equally Impassible?
* Whether Impassibility Excludes Actual Sensation From Glorified Bodies?
* Whether In The Blessed, After The Resurrection, All The Senses Will Be In Act?
