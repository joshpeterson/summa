# Of The Integrity Of The Bodies In The Resurrection

We must next consider the integrity of the bodies in the resurrection. Under this head there are five points of inquiry:
(1) Whether all the members of the human body will rise again therein?
(2) Whether the hair and nails will?
(3) Whether the humors will?
(4) Whether whatever the body contained belonging to the truth of human nature will rise again?
(5) Whether whatever it contained materially will rise again?
