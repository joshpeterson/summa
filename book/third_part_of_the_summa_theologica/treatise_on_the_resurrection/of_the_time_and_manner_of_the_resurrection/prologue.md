# Of The Time And Manner Of The Resurrection

We must now consider the time and manner of the resurrection. Under this head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether the time of the resurrection should be delayed until the end of the world?
(2) Whether that time is hidden?
(3) Whether the resurrection will occur at night-time?
(4) Whether it will happen suddenly?

* Whether The Time Of Our Resurrection Is Hidden?

* Whether The Resurrection Will Happen Suddenly Or By Degrees?
