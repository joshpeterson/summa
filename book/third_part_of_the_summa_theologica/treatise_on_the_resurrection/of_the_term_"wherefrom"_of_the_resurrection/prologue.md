# Of The Term "Wherefrom" Of The Resurrection

We must now consider the term "wherefrom" of the resurrection; and under this head there are three points of inquiry:
(1) Whether death is the term "wherefrom" of the resurrection in every case?
(2) Whether ashes are, or dust?
(3) Whether this dust has a natural inclination towards the soul?

* Whether Death Will Be The Term "Wherefrom" Of The Resurrection In All Cases?
* Whether All Will Rise Again From Ashes?
* Whether The Ashes From Which The Human Body Will Be Restored Have Any Natural Inclination Towards The Soul Which Will Be United To Them?
