# Of The Agility Of The Bodies Of The Blessed

We must now consider the agility of the bodies of the blessed in the resurrection. Under this head there are three points of inquiry:
(1) Whether the glorified bodies will be agile?
(2) Whether they will move?
(3) Whether they will move instantaneously?

* Whether The Glorified Bodies Will Be Agile?
* Whether The Saints Will Never Use Their Agility For The Purpose Of Movement?
* Whether The Movement Of The Saints Will Be Instantaneous?
