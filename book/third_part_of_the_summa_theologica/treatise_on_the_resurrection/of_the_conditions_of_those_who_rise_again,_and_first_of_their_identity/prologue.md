# Of The Conditions Of Those Who Rise Again, And First Of Their Identity

In the next place we must consider the conditions of those who rise again. Here we shall consider: (1) Those which concern the good and wicked in common; (2) those which concern the good only; (3) those which concern only the wicked. Three things concern the good and wicked in common, namely their identity, their integrity, and their quality: and we shall inquire (1) about their identity; (2) about their integrity; (3) about their quality.  Under the first head there are three points of inquiry:
(1) Whether the body will rise again identically the same?
(2) Whether it will be the self-same man?
(3) Whether it is necessary that the same ashes should return to the same parts in which they were before?

* Whether In The Resurrection The Soul Will Be Reunited To The Same Identical Body?
* Whether It Will Be Identically The Same Man That Shall Rise Again?
* Whether The Ashes Of The Human Body Must Needs, By The Resurrection, Return To The Same Parts Of The Body That Were Dissolved Into Them?
