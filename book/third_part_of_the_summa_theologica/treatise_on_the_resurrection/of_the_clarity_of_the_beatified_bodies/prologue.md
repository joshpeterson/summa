# Of The Clarity Of The Beatified Bodies

We must now consider the clarity of the beatified bodies at the resurrection. Under this head there are three points of inquiry:
(1) Whether there will be clarity in the glorified bodies?
(2) Whether this clarity will be visible to the non-glorified eye?
(3) Whether a glorified body will of necessity be seen by a non-glorified body?

* Whether Clarity Is Becoming To The Glorified Body?
* Whether The Clarity Of The Glorified Body Is Visible To The Non-glorified Eye?
* Whether A Glorified Body Will Be Necessarily Seen By A Non-glorified Body?
