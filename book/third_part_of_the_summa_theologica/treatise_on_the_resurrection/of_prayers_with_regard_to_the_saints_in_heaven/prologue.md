# Of Prayers With Regard To The Saints In Heaven

We must now consider prayer with regard to the saints in heaven. Under this head there are three points of inquiry:
(1) Whether the saints have knowledge of our prayers?
(2) Whether we should beseech them to pray for us?
(3) Whether the prayers they pour forth for us are always granted?

* Whether The Saints Have Knowledge Of Our Prayers?
* Whether We Ought To Call Upon The Saints To Pray For Us?
* Whether The Prayers Which The Saints Pour Forth To God For Us Are Always Granted?
