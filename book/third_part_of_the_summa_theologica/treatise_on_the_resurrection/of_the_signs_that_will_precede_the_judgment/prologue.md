# Of The Signs That Will Precede The Judgment

We must next consider the signs that will precede the judgment: and under this head there are three points of inquiry:
(1) Whether any signs will precede the Lord's coming to judgment?
(2) Whether in very truth the sun and moon will be darkened?
(3) Whether the powers of the heavens will be moved when the Lord shall come?
