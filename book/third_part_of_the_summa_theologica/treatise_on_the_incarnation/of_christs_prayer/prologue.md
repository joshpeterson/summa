# Of Christ's Prayer

We must now consider Christ's prayer; and under this head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether it is becoming that Christ should pray?
(2) Whether it pertains to Him in respect of His sensuality?
(3) Whether it is becoming to Him to pray for Himself or only for others?
(4) Whether every prayer of His was heard?

* Whether It Is Becoming Of Christ To Pray?
* Whether It Pertains To Christ To Pray According To His Sensuality?
* Whether It Was Fitting That Christ Should Pray For Himself?
* Whether Christ's Prayer Was Always Heard?
