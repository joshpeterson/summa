# Of Christ's Doctrine

We have now to consider Christ's doctrine, about which there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether Christ should have preached to the Jews only, or to the Gentiles also?
(2) Whether in preaching He should have avoided the opposition of the Jews?
(3) Whether He should have preached in an open or in a hidden manner?
(4) Whether He should have preached by word only, or also by writing?  Concerning the time when He began to teach, we have spoken above when treating of His baptism (Q[29], A[3]).
