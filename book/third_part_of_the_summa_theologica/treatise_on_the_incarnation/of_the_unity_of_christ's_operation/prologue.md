# Of The Unity Of Christ's Operation

We must now consider the unity of Christ's operation; and under this head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether in Christ there was one or several operations of the Godhead and Manhood?
(2) Whether in Christ there were several operations of the human nature?
(3) Whether Christ by His human operation merited anything for Himself?
(4) Whether He merited anything for us by it?

* Whether In Christ There Is Only One Operation Of The Godhead And Manhood?
* Whether In Christ There Are Several Human Operations?
* Whether The Human Action Of Christ Could Be Meritorious To Him?
* Whether Christ Could Merit For Others?
