# Of Christ's Resurrection

We have now to consider those things that concern Christ's Exaltation; and we shall deal with (1) His Resurrection; (2) His Ascension; (3) His sitting at the right hand of God the Father; (4) His Judiciary Power. Under the first heading there is a fourfold consideration: (1) Christ's Resurrection in itself; (2) the quality of the Person rising; (3) the manifestation of the Resurrection; (4) its causality. Concerning the first there are four points of inquiry:
(1) The necessity of His Resurrection;
(2) The time of the Resurrection;
(3) Its order;
(4) Its cause.

* Whether It Was Necessary For Christ To Rise Again?
* Whether It Was Fitting For Christ To Rise Again On The Third Day?
* Whether Christ Was The First To Rise From The Dead?
* Whether Christ Was The Cause Of His Own Resurrection?
