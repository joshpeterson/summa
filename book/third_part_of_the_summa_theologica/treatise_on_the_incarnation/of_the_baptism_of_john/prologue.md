# Of The Baptism Of John

We now proceed to consider the baptism wherewith Christ was baptized. And since Christ was baptized with the baptism of John, we shall consider (1) the baptism of John in general; (2) the baptizing of Christ. In regard to the former there are six points of inquiry:
(1) Whether it was fitting that John should baptize?
(2) Whether that baptism was from God?
(3) Whether it conferred grace?
(4) Whether others besides Christ should have received that baptism?
(5) Whether that baptism should have ceased when Christ was baptized?
(6) Whether those who received John's baptism had afterwards to receive Christ's baptism?

* Whether It Was Fitting That John Should Baptize?
* Whether The Baptism Of John Was From God?
* Whether Grace Was Given In The Baptism Of John?
* Whether Christ Alone Should Have Been Baptized With The Baptism Of John?
* Whether John's Baptism Should Have Ceased After Christ Was Baptized?
* Whether Those Who Had Been Baptized With John's Baptism Had To Be Baptized With The Baptism Of Christ?
