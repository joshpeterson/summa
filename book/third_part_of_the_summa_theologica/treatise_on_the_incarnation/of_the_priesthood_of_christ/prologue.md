# Of The Priesthood Of Christ

We have now to consider the Priesthood of Christ; and under this head there are six points of inquiry:
(1) Whether it is fitting that Christ should be a priest?
(2) Of the victim offered by this priest;
(3) Of the effect of this priesthood;
(4) Whether the effect of His priesthood pertains to Himself, or only to others?
(5) Of the eternal duration of His priesthood;
(6) Whether He should be called "a priest according to the order of Melchisedech"?

* Whether It Is Fitting That Christ Should Be A Priest?
* Whether Christ Was Himself Both Priest And Victim?
* Whether The Effect Of Christ's Priesthood Is The Expiation Of Sins?
* Whether The Effect Of The Priesthood Of Christ Pertained Not Only To Others, But Also To Himself?
* Whether The Priesthood Of Christ Endures For Ever?
* Whether The Priesthood Of Christ Was According To The Order Of Melchisedech?
