# Of The Defects Of Body Assumed By The Son Of God

We must now consider the defects Christ assumed in the human nature; and first, of the defects of body; secondly, of the defects of soul.  Under the first head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether the Son of God should have assumed in human nature defects of body?
(2) Whether He assumed the obligation of being subject to these defects?
(3) Whether He contracted these defects?
(4) Whether He assumed all these defects?

* Whether The Son Of God In Human Nature Ought To Have Assumed Defects Of Body?
* Whether Christ Was Of Necessity Subject To These Defects?
* Whether Christ Contracted These Defects?
* Whether Christ Ought To Have Assumed All The Bodily Defects Of Men?
