# Of The Annunciation Of The Blessed Virgin

We now have to consider the Blessed Virgin's Annunciation, concerning which there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether it was befitting that announcement should be made to her of that which was to be begotten of her?
(2) By whom should this announcement be made?
(3) In what manner should this announcement be made?
(4) Of the order observed in the Annunciation.

* Whether It Was Necessary To Announce To The Blessed Virgin That Which Was To Be Done In Her?
* Whether The Annunciation Should Have Been Made By An Angel To The Blessed Virgin?
* Whether The Angel Of Annunciation Should Have Appeared To The Virgin In A Bodily Vision?
* Whether The Annunciation Took Place In Becoming Order?
