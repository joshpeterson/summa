# Of The Manifestation Of The Resurrection

We have now to consider the manifestation of the Resurrection: concerning which there are six points of inquiry:
(1) Whether Christ's Resurrection ought to have been manifested to all men or only to some special individuals?
(2) Whether it was fitting that they should see Him rise?
(3) Whether He ought to have lived with the disciples after the Resurrection?
(4) Whether it was fitting for Him to appeal to the disciples "in another shape"?
(5) Whether He ought to have demonstrated the Resurrection by proofs?
(6) Of the cogency of those proofs.
