# Of Christ's Transfiguration

We now consider Christ's transfiguration; and here there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether it was fitting that Christ should be transfigured?
(2) Whether the clarity of the transfiguration was the clarity of glory?
(3) Of the witnesses of the transfiguration;
(4) Of the testimony of the Father's voice.

* Whether It Was Fitting That Christ Should Be Transfigured?
* Whether This Clarity Was The Clarity Of Glory?
* Whether The Witnesses Of The Transfiguration Were Fittingly Chosen?
* Whether The Testimony Of The Father's Voice, Saying, "This Is My Beloved Son," Was Fittingly Added?
