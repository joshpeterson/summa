# Of The Acquired Or Empiric Knowledge Of Christ's Soul

We must now consider the acquired or empiric knowledge of Christ's soul; and under this head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether Christ knew all things by this knowledge?
(2) Whether He advanced in this knowledge?
(3) Whether He learned anything from man?
(4) Whether He received anything from angels?

* Whether Christ Knew All Things By This Acquired Or Empiric Knowledge?
* Whether Christ Advanced In Acquired Or Empiric Knowledge?
* Whether Christ Learned Anything From Man?
* Whether Christ Received Knowledge From The Angels?
