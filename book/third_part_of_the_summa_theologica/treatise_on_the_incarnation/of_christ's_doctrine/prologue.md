# Of Christ's Doctrine

We have now to consider Christ's doctrine, about which there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether Christ should have preached to the Jews only, or to the Gentiles also?
(2) Whether in preaching He should have avoided the opposition of the Jews?
(3) Whether He should have preached in an open or in a hidden manner?
(4) Whether He should have preached by word only, or also by writing?  Concerning the time when He began to teach, we have spoken above when treating of His baptism (Q[29], A[3]).

* Whether Christ Should Have Preached Not Only To The Jews, But Also To The Gentiles?
* Whether Christ Should Have Preached To The Jews Without Offending Them?
* Whether Christ Should Have Taught All Things Openly?
* Whether Christ Should Have Committed His Doctrine To Writing?
