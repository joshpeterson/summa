# Of The Predestination Of Christ

We shall now consider the predestination of Christ. Under this head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether Christ was predestinated?
(2) Whether He was predestinated as man?
(3) Whether His predestination is the exemplar of ours?
(4) Whether it is the cause of our predestination?

* Whether It Is Befitting That Christ Should Be Predestinated?
* Whether This Proposition Is False: "Christ As Man Was Predestinated To Be The Son Of God"?
* Whether Christ's Predestination Is The Exemplar Of Ours?
* Whether Christ's Predestination Is The Cause Of Ours?
