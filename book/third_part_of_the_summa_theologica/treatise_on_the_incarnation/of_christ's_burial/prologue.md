# Of Christ's Burial

We have now to consider Christ's burial, concerning which there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether it was fitting for Christ to be buried?
(2) Concerning the manner of His burial;
(3) Whether His body was decomposed in the tomb?
(4) Concerning the length of time He lay in the tomb.

* Whether It Was Fitting For Christ To Be Buried?
* Whether Christ Was Buried In A Becoming Manner?
* Whether Christ's Body Was Reduced To Dust In The Tomb?
* Whether Christ Was In The Tomb Only One Day And Two Nights?
