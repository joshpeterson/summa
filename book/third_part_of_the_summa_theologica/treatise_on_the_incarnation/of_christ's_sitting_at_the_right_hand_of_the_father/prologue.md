# Of Christ's Sitting At The Right Hand Of The Father

WE have now to consider Christ's sitting at the right hand of the Father, concerning which there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether Christ is seated at the right hand of the Father?
(2) Whether this belongs to Him according to the Divine Nature?
(3) Whether it belongs to Him according to His human nature?
(4) Whether it is something proper to Christ?

* Whether It Is Fitting That Christ Should Sit At The Right Hand Of God The Father?
* Whether It Belongs To Christ As God To Sit At The Right Hand Of The Father?
* Whether It Belongs To Christ As Man To Sit At The Right Hand Of The Father?
* Whether It Is Proper To Christ To Sit At The Right Hand Of The Father?
