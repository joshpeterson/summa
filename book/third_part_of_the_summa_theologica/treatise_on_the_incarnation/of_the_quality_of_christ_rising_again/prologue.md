# Of The Quality Of Christ Rising Again

We have now to consider the quality of the rising Christ, which presents four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether Christ had a true body after His Resurrection?
(2) Whether He rose with His complete body?
(3) Whether His was a glorified body?
(4) Of the scars which showed in His body.

* Whether Christ Had A True Body After His Resurrection?
* Whether Christ's Body Rose Glorified?
* Whether Christ's Body Rose Again Entire?
* Whether Christ's Body Ought To Have Risen With Its Scars?
