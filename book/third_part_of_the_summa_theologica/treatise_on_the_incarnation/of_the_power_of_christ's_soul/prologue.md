# Of The Power Of Christ's Soul

We must now consider the power of Christ's soul; and under this head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether He had omnipotence simply?
(2) Whether He had omnipotence with regard to corporeal creatures?
(3) Whether He had omnipotence with regard to His own body?
(4) Whether He had omnipotence as regards the execution of His own will?

* Whether The Soul Of Christ Had Omnipotence?
* Whether The Soul Of Christ Had Omnipotence With Regard To The Transmutation Of Creatures?
* Whether The Soul Of Christ Had Omnipotence With Regard To His Own Body?
* Whether The Soul Of Christ Had Omnipotence As Regards The Execution Of His Will?
