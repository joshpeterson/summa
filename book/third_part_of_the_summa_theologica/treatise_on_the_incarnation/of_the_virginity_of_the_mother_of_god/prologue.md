# Of The Virginity Of The Mother Of God

We now have to consider the virginity of the Mother of God; concerning which there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether she was a virgin in conceiving?
(2) Whether she was a virgin in His Birth?
(3) Whether she remained a virgin after His Birth?
(4) Whether she took a vow of virginity?

* Whether The Mother Of God Was A Virgin In Conceiving Christ?
* Whether Christ's Mother Was A Virgin In His Birth?
* Whether Christ's Mother Remained A Virgin After His Birth?
* Whether The Mother Of God Took A Vow Of Virginity?
