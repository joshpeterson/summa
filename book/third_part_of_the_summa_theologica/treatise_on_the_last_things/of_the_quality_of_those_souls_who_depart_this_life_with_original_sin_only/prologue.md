# Of The Quality Of Those Souls Who Depart This Life With Original Sin Only

We must next consider the various qualities of souls that are stripped of their bodies, according to their respective states; and first we shall treat of the souls which depart this life with original sin only.  Under this head there are two points of inquiry:
(1) Whether these souls suffer from a bodily fire, and are inflicted with punishment by fire?
(2) Whether these souls suffer from a spiritual torment within themselves?

* Whether These Same Souls Suffer Spiritual Affliction On Account Of The State In Which They Are?
