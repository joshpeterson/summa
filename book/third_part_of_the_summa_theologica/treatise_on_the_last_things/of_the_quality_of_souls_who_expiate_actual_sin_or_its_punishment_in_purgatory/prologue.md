# Of The Quality Of Souls Who Expiate Actual Sin Or Its Punishment In Purgatory

We must next treat of the souls which after this life expiate the punishment of their actual sins in the fire of Purgatory.  Under this head there are six points of inquiry:
(1) Whether the pain of Purgatory surpasses all the temporal pains of this life?
(2) Whether that punishment is voluntary?
(3) Whether the souls in Purgatory are punished by the demons?
(4) Whether venial sin as regards its guilt is expiated by the pains of Purgatory?
(5) Whether the fire of Purgatory frees from the debt of punishment?
(6) Whether one is freed from that punishment sooner than another?
