# Of The Gifts Of The Blessed

[*The Latin 'dos' signifies a   dowry.]  We must now consider the gifts of the blessed; under which head there are five points of inquiry:
(1) Whether any gifts should be assigned to the blessed?
(2) Whether a gift differs from beatitude?
(3) Whether it is fitting for Christ to have gifts?
(4) Whether this is competent to the angels?
(5) Whether three gifts of the soul are rightly assigned?

* Whether Any Gifts Should Be Assigned As Dowry To The Blessed?
* Whether The Dowry Is The Same As Beatitude?
* Whether It Is Fitting That Christ Should Receive A Dowry?
* Whether The Angels Receive The Dowries?
* Whether Three Dowries Of The Soul Are Suitably Assigned?
