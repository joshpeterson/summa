# Of God's Mercy And Justice Towards The Damned

We must next consider God's justice and mercy towards the damned: under which head there are five points of inquiry:
(1) Whether by Divine justice an eternal punishment is inflicted on sinners?
(2) Whether by God's mercy all punishment both of men and of demons comes to an end?
(3) Whether at least the punishment of men comes to an end?
(4) Whether at least the punishment of Christians has an end?
(5) Whether there is an end to the punishment of those who have performed works of mercy?

* Whether By Divine Justice An Eternal Punishment Is Inflicted On Sinners?
* Whether By God's Mercy All Punishment Of The Damned, Both Men And Demons, Comes To An End?
* Whether God's Mercy Suffers At Least Men To Be Punished Eternally?
* Whether The Punishment Of Christians Is Brought To An End By The Mercy Of God?
* Whether All Those Who Perform Works Of Mercy Will Be Punished Eternally?
