# Of The Relations Of The Saints Towards The Damned

We must next consider the relations of the saints towards the damned. Under this head there are three points of inquiry:
(1) Whether the saints see the sufferings of the damned?
(2) Whether they pity them?
(3) Whether they rejoice in their sufferings?

* Whether The Blessed In Heaven Will See The Sufferings Of The Damned?
* Whether The Blessed Pity The Unhappiness Of The Damned?
* Whether The Blessed Rejoice In The Punishment Of The Wicked?
