# Of The Change Of Bread And Wine Into The Body And Blood Of Christ

We have to consider the change of the bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ; under which head there are eight points of inquiry:
(1) Whether the substance of bread and wine remain in this sacrament after the consecration?*
(2) Whether it is annihilated?
(3) Whether it is changed into the body and blood of Christ?
(4) Whether the accidents remain after the change?
(5) Whether the substantial form remains there?
(6) Whether this change is instantaneous?
(7) Whether it is more miraculous than any other change?
(8) By what words it may be suitably expressed?  [*The titles of the Articles here given were taken by St. Thomas from his Commentary on the Sentences (Sent. iv, D, 90). However, in writing the Articles he introduced a new point of inquiry, that of the First Article; and substituted another division of the matter under discussion, as may be seen by referring to the titles of the various Articles. Most editions have ignored St. Thomas's original division, and give the one to which he subsequently adhered.]

* Whether The Body Of Christ Be In This Sacrament In Very Truth, Or Merely As In A Figure Or Sign?
* Whether In This Sacrament The Substance Of The Bread And Wine Remains After The Consecration?
* Whether The Substance Of The Bread Or Wine Is Annihilated After The Consecration Of This Sacrament, Or Dissolved Into Their Original Matter?
* Whether Bread Can Be Converted Into The Body Of Christ?
* Whether The Accidents Of The Bread And Wine Remain In This Sacrament After The Change?
* Whether The Substantial Form Of The Bread Remains In This Sacrament After The Consecration?
* Whether This Change Is Wrought Instantaneously?
* Whether This Proposition Is False: "The Body Of Christ Is Made Out Of Bread"?
