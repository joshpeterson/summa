# Of The Return Of Sins Which Have Been Taken Away By Penance

We must now consider the return of sins which have been taken away by Penance: under which head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether sins which have been taken away by Penance return simply through a subsequent sin?
(2) Whether more specially as regards certain sins they return, in a way, on account of ingratitude?
(3) Whether the debt of punishment remains the same for sins thus returned?
(4) Whether this ingratitude, on account of which sins return, is a special sin?

* Whether Sins Once Forgiven Return Through A Subsequent Sin?
* Whether Sins That Have Been Forgiven, Return Through Ingratitude Which Is Shown Especially In Four Kinds Of Sin?
* Whether The Debt Of Punishment That Arises Through Ingratitude In Respect Of A Subsequent Sin Is As Great As That Of The Sins Previously Pardoned?
* Whether The Ingratitude Whereby A Subsequent Sin Causes The Return Of Previous Sins, Is A Special Sin?
