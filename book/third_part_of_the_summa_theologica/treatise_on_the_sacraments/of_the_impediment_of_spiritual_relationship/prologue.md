# Of The Impediment Of Spiritual Relationship

We must now consider the impediment of spiritual relationship: under which head there are five points of inquiry:

(2) From what cause is it contracted?
(3) Between whom?
(4) Whether it passes from husband to wife?
(5) Whether it passes to the father's carnal children?
