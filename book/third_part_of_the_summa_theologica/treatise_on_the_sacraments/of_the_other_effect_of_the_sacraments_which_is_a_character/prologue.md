# Of The Other Effect Of The Sacraments, Which Is A Character

We have now to consider the other effect of the sacraments, which is a character: and concerning this there are six points of inquiry:
(1) Whether by the sacraments a character is produced in the soul?
(2) What is this character?
(3) Of whom is this character?
(4) What is its subject?
(5) Is it indelible?
(6) Whether every sacrament imprints a character?

* Whether A Sacrament Imprints A Character On The Soul?
* Whether A Character Is A Spiritual Power?
* Whether The Sacramental Character Is The Character Of Christ?
* Whether The Character Be Subjected In The Powers Of The Soul?
* Whether A Character Can Be Blotted Out From The Soul?
* Whether A Character Is Imprinted By Each Sacrament Of The New Law?
