# Of The Number Of The Sacraments

We have now to consider the number of the sacraments: and concerning this there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether there are seven sacraments?
(2) The order of the sacraments among themselves;
(3) Their mutual comparison;
(4) Whether all the sacraments are necessary for salvation?

* Whether There Should Be Seven Sacraments?
* Whether The Order Of The Sacraments, As Given Above, Is Becoming?
* Whether The Eucharist Is The Greatest Of The Sacraments?
* Whether All The Sacraments Are Necessary For Salvation?
