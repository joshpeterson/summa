# Of Legal Relationship, Which Is By Adoption

We must now consider legal relationship which is by adoption. Under this head there are three points of inquiry:
(1) What is adoption?
(2) Whether one contracts through it a tie that is an impediment to marriage?
(3) Between which persons is this tie contracted.

* Whether Adoption Is Rightly Defined?
* Whether A Tie That Is An Impediment To Marriage Is Contracted Through Adoption?
* Whether Legal Relationship Is Contracted Only Between The Adopting Father And The Adopted Child?
