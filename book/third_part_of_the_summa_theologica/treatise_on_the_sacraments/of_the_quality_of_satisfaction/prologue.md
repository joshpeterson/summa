# Of The Quality Of Satisfaction

We must now consider the quality of satisfaction, under which head there are five points of inquiry:
(1) Whether a man can satisfy for one sin without satisfying for another?
(2) Whether if a man fall into sin after being contrite for all his sins, he can, now that he has lost charity, satisfy for his other sins which were pardoned him through his contrition?
(3) Whether a man's previous satisfaction begins to avail when he recovers charity?
(4) Whether works done without charity merit any good?
(5) Whether such works avail for the mitigation of the pains of hell?

* Whether A Man Can Satisfy For One Sin Without Satisfying For Another?
* Whether, When Deprived Of Charity, A Man Can Make Satisfaction For Sins For Which He Was Previously Contrite?
* Whether Previous Satisfaction Begins To Avail After Man Is Restored To Charity?
* Whether Works Done Without Charity Merit Any, At Least Temporal, Good?
* Whether The Aforesaid Works Avail For The Mitigation Of The Pains Of Hell?
