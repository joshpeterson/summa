# Of The Use Which Christ Made Of This Sacrament At Its Institution

We have now to consider the use which Christ made of this sacrament at its institution; under which heading there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether Christ received His own body and blood?
(2) Whether He gave it to Judas?
(3) What kind of body did He receive or give, namely, was it passible or impassible?
(4) What would have been the condition of Christ's body under this sacrament, if it had been reserved or consecrated during the three days He lay dead?

* Whether Christ Received His Own Body And Blood?
* Whether Christ Gave His Body To Judas?
* Whether Christ Received And Gave To The Disciples His Impassible Body?
* Whether, If This Sacrament Had Been Reserved In A Pyx, Or Consecrated At The Moment Of Christ's Death By One Of The Apostles, Christ Himself Would Have Died There?
