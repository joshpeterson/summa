# Of Those Whom Indulgences Avail

We must now consider those whom indulgences avail: under which head there are four points of inquiry:

(2) Whether they avail religious?
(3) Whether they avail a person who does not fulfill the conditions for which the indulgence is given?
(4) Whether they avail him who grants them?
