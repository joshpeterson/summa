# Of The Solemn Rite Of Penance

We must now consider the solemn rite of Penance: under which head there are three points of inquiry:
(1) Whether a penance can be published or solemnized?
(2) Whether a solemn penance can be repeated?
(3) Whether public penance should be imposed on women?

* Whether A Penance Should Be Published Or Solemnized?
* Whether A Solemn Penance Can Be Repeated?
* Whether Solemn Penance Should Be Imposed On Women And Clerics, And Whether Any Priest Can Impose It?
