# Of The Necessity Of The Sacraments

We must now consider the necessity of the sacraments; concerning which there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether sacraments are necessary for man's salvation?
(2) Whether they were necessary in the state that preceded sin?
(3) Whether they were necessary in the state after sin and before Christ?
(4) Whether they were necessary after Christ's coming?

* Whether Sacraments Are Necessary For Man's Salvation?
* Whether Before Sin Sacraments Were Necessary To Man?
* Whether There Should Have Been Sacraments After Sin, Before Christ?
* Whether There Was Need For Any Sacraments After Christ Came?
