# Of Indulgences

We must now consider indulgence: (1) in itself; (2) those who grant indulgence; (3) those who receive it.  Under the first head there are three points of inquiry:
(1) Whether an indulgence remits any part of the punishment due for the satisfaction of sins?
(2) Whether indulgences are as effective as they claim to be?
(3) Whether an indulgence should be granted for temporal assistance?
