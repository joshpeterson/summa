# Of Absolution From Excommunication

We must now consider absolution from excommunication: under which head there are three points of inquiry:
(1) Whether any priest can absolve his subject from excommunication?
(2) Whether a man can be absolved from excommunication against his will?
(3) Whether a man can be absolved from one excommunication without being absolved from another?

* Whether Any Priest Can Absolve His Subject From Excommunication?
* Whether Anyone Can Be Absolved Against His Will?
* Whether A Man Can Be Absolved From One Excommunication Without Being Absolved From All?
