# Of Those Who Confer This Sacrament

We must now consider those who confer this sacrament. Under this head there are two points of inquiry:
(1) Whether a bishop alone can confer this sacrament?
(2) Whether a heretic or any other person cut off from the Church can confer this sacrament?

* Whether A Bishop Alone Confers The Sacrament Of Order?
* Whether Heretics And Those Who Are Cut Off From The Church Can Confer Orders?
