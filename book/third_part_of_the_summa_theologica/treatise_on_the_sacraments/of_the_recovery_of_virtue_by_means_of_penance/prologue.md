# Of The Recovery Of Virtue By Means Of Penance

We must now consider the recovery of virtues by means of Penance, under which head there are six points of inquiry:
(1) Whether virtues are restored through Penance?
(2) Whether they are restored in equal measure?
(3) Whether equal dignity is restored to the penitent?
(4) Whether works of virtue are deadened by subsequent sin?
(5) Whether works deadened by sin revive through Penance?
(6) Whether dead works, i.e. works that are done without charity, are quickened by Penance?

* Whether The Virtues Are Restored Through Penance?
* Whether, After Penance, Man Rises Again To Equal Virtue?
* Whether, By Penance, Man Is Restored To His Former Dignity?
* Whether Virtuous Deeds Done In Charity Can Be Deadened?
* Whether Deeds Deadened By Sin, Are Revived By Penance?
* Whether The Effect Of Subsequent Penance Is To Quicken Even Dead Works?
