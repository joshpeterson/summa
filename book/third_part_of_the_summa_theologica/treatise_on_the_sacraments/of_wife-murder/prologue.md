# Of Wife-murder

We must now consider wife-murder, under which head there are two points of inquiry:
(1) Whether in a certain case it is lawful to kill one's wife?
(2) Whether wife-murder is an impediment to marriage?

* Whether It Is Lawful For A Man To Kill His Wife If She Be Discovered In The Act Of Adultery?
* Whether Wife-murder Is An Impediment To Marriage?
