# Of The Impediment Of Error

We must now consider the impediments to matrimony in particular, and in the first place the impediment of error. Under this head there are two points of inquiry:
(1) Whether error of its very nature is an impediment to matrimony?
(2) What kind of error?

* Whether It Is Right To Reckon Error As An Impediment To Marriage?
* Whether Every Error Is An Impediment To Matrimony?
