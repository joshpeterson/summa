# Matrimony

OF THE SACRAMENT OF MATRIMONY AS DIRECTED TO AN OFFICE OF NATURE (FOUR ARTICLES)  In the next place we must consider matrimony. We must treat of it (1) as directed to an office of nature; (2) as a sacrament; (3) as considered absolutely and in itself. Under the first head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether it is of natural law?
(2) Whether it is a matter of precept?
(3) Whether its act is lawful?
(4) Whether its act can be meritorious?

* Whether Matrimony Is Of Natural Law?
* Whether Matrimony Still Comes Under A Precept?
* Whether The Marriage Act Is Always Sinful?
* Whether The Marriage Act Is Meritorious?
