# Of The Marriage Goods

[*"Bona matrimonii," variously rendered   marriage goods, marriage blessings, and advantages of marriage.]  In the next place we must consider the marriage goods. Under this head there are six points of inquiry:
(1) Whether certain goods are necessary in order to excuse marriage?
(2) Whether those assigned are sufficient?
(3) Whether the sacrament is the principal among the goods?
(4) Whether the marriage act is excused from sin by the aforesaid goods?
(5) Whether it can ever be excused from sin without them?
(6) Whether in their absence it is always a mortal sin?
