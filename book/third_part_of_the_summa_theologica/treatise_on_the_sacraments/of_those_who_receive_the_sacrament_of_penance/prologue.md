# Of Those Who Receive The Sacrament Of Penance

We must now consider the recipients of the sacrament of Penance: under which head there are three points of inquiry:

(2) Whether it can be in the saints in glory?
(3) Whether in the good or bad angels?

* Whether Penance Can Be In The Innocent?
* Whether The Saints In Glory Have Penance?
* Whether An Angel Can Be The Subject Of Penance?
