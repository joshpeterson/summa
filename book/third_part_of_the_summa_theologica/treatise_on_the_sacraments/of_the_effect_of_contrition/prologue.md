# Of The Effect Of Contrition

We must now consider the effect of contrition: under which head there are three points of inquiry:
(1) Whether the remission of sin is the effect of contrition?
(2) Whether contrition can take away the debt of punishment entirely?
(3) Whether slight contrition suffices to blot out great sins?

* Whether The Forgiveness Of Sin Is The Effect Of Contrition?
* Whether Contrition Can Take Away The Debt Of Punishment Entirely?
* Whether Slight Contrition Suffices To Blot Out Great Sins?
