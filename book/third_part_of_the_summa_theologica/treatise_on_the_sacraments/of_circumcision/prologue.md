# Of Circumcision

We have now to consider things that are preparatory to Baptism: and (1) that which preceded Baptism, viz. Circumcision, (2) those which accompany Baptism, viz. Catechism and Exorcism.  Concerning the first there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether circumcision was a preparation for, and a figure of, Baptism?
(2) Its institution;
(3) Its rite;
(4) Its effect.

* Whether Circumcision Was A Preparation For, And A Figure Of Baptism?
* Whether Circumcision Was Instituted In A Fitting Manner?
* Whether The Rite Of Circumcision Was Fitting?
* Whether Circumcision Bestowed Sanctifying Grace?
