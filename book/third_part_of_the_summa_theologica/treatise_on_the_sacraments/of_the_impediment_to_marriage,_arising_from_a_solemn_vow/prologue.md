# Of The Impediment To Marriage, Arising From A Solemn Vow

We must next consider the impediments which supervene to marriage. We shall consider (1) the impediment which affects an unconsummated marriage, namely a solemn vow: (2) the impediment which affects a consummated marriage, namely fornication. Under the first head there are three points of inquiry:
(1) Whether either party after the marriage has been consummated can enter religion without the other's consent?
(2) Whether they can enter religion before the consummation of the marriage?
(3) Whether the wife can take another husband if her former husband has entered religion before the consummation of the marriage?

* Whether One Party After The Marriage Has Been Consummated Can Enter Religion Without The Other's Consent?
* Whether Before The Marriage Has Been Consummated One Consort Can Enter Religion Without The Other's Consent?
* Whether The Wife May Take Another Husband If Her Husband Has Entered Religion Before The Consummation Of The Marriage?
