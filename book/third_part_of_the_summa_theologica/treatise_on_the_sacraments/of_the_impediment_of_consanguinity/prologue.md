# Of The Impediment Of Consanguinity

We must next consider the impediment of consanguinity. Under this head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether consanguinity is rightly defined by some?
(2) Whether it is fittingly distinguished by degrees and lines?
(3) Whether certain degrees are by natural law an impediment to marriage?
(4) Whether the impediment degrees can be fixed by the ordinance of the Church?

* Whether Consanguinity Is Fittingly Distinguished By Degrees And Lines?
* Whether Consanguinity Is An Impediment To Marriage By Virtue Of The Natural Law?
* Whether The Degrees Of Consanguinity That Are An Impediment To Marriage Could Be Fixed By The Church?
