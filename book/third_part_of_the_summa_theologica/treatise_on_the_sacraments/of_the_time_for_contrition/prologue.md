# Of The Time For Contrition

We must now consider the time for contrition: under which head there are three points of inquiry:
(1) Whether the whole of this life is the time for contrition?
(2) Whether it is expedient to grieve continually for our sins?
(3) Whether souls grieve for their sins even after this life?

* Whether The Whole Of This Life Is The Time For Contrition?
* Whether It Is Expedient To Grieve For Sin Continually?
* Whether Our Souls Are Contrite For Sins Even After This Life?
