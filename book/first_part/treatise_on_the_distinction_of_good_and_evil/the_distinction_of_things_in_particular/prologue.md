# The Distinction Of Things In Particular

We must now consider the distinction of things in particular; and firstly the distinction of good and evil; and then the distinction of the spiritual and corporeal creatures.  Concerning the first, we inquire into evil and its cause.  Concerning evil, six points are to be considered:
(1) Whether evil is a nature?
(2) Whether evil is found in things?
(3) Whether good is the subject of evil?
(4) Whether evil totally corrupts good?
(5) The division of evil into pain and fault.
(6) Whether pain, or fault, has more the nature of evil?

* Whether Evil Is A Nature?

* Whether Evil Is In Good As In Its Subject?
* Whether Evil Corrupts The Whole Good?
* Whether Evil Is Adequately Divided Into Pain And Fault?
* Whether Pain Has The Nature Of Evil More Than Fault Has?
