# The Cause Of Evil

We next inquire into the cause of evil. Concerning this there are three points of inquire:
(1) Whether good can be the cause of evil?
(2) Whether the supreme good, God, is the cause of evil?
(3) Whether there be any supreme evil, which is the first cause of all evils?

* Whether Good Can Be The Cause Of Evil?
* Whether The Supreme Good, God, Is The Cause Of Evil?
* Whether There Be One Supreme Evil Which Is The Cause Of Every Evil?
