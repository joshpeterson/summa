# Of The Beginning Of The Duration Of Creatures

Next must be considered the beginning of the duration of creatures, about which there are three points for treatment:
(1) Whether creatures always existed?
(2) Whether that they began to exist in an article of Faith?
(3) How God is said to have created heaven and earth in the beginning?

* Whether The Universe Of Creatures Always Existed?
* Whether It Is An Article Of Faith That The World Began?
* Whether The Creation Of Things Was In The Beginning Of Time?
