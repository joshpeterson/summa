# Of The Preservation Of The Individual In The Primitive State

We next consider what belongs to the bodily state of the first man: first, as regards the preservation of the individual; secondly, as regards the preservation of the species.  Under the first head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether man in the state of innocence was immortal?
(2) Whether he was impassible?
(3) Whether he stood in need of food?
(4) Whether he would have obtained immortality by the tree of life?

* Whether In The State Of Innocence Man Would Have Been Immortal?
* Whether In The State Of Innocence Man Would Have Been Passible?
* Whether In The State Of Innocence Man Had Need Of Food?
* Whether In The State Of Innocence Man Would Have Acquired Immortality By The Tree Of Life?
