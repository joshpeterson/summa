# Of The Mode And Order Of Understanding

We come now to consider the mode and order of understanding. Under this head there are eight points of inquiry:
(1) Whether our intellect understands by abstracting the species from the phantasms?
(2) Whether the intelligible species abstracted from the phantasms are what our intellect understands, or that whereby it understands?
(3) Whether our intellect naturally first understands the more universal?
(4) Whether our intellect can know many things at the same time?
(5) Whether our intellect understands by the process of composition and division?
(6) Whether the intellect can err?
(7) Whether one intellect can understand better than another?
(8) Whether our intellect understands the indivisible before the divisible?

* Whether Our Intellect Understands Corporeal And Material Things By Abstraction From Phantasms?
* Whether The Intelligible Species Abstracted From The Phantasm Is Related To Our Intellect As That Which Is Understood?
* Whether The More Universal Is First In Our Intellectual Cognition?
* Whether We Can Understand Many Things At The Same Time?
* Whether Our Intellect Understands By Composition And Division?
* Whether The Intellect Can Be False?
* Whether One Person Can Understand One And The Same Thing Better Than Another Can?
* Whether The Intellect Understands The Indivisible Before The Divisible?
