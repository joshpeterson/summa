# Of The Will

We next consider the will. Under this head there are five points of inquiry:
(1) Whether the will desires something of necessity?
(2) Whether it desires anything of necessity?
(3) Whether it is a higher power than the intellect?
(4) Whether the will moves the intellect?
(5) Whether the will is divided into irascible and concupiscible?

* Whether The Will Desires Something Of Necessity?
* Whether The Will Desires Of Necessity, Whatever It Desires?
* Whether The Will Is A Higher Power Than The Intellect?
* Whether The Will Moves The Intellect?
* Whether We Should Distinguish Irascible And Concupiscible Parts In The Superior Appetite?
