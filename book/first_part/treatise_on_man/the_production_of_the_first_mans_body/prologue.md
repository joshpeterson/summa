# The Production Of The First Man's Body

We have now to consider the production of the first man's body. Under this head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) The matter from which it was produced;
(2) The author by whom it was produced;
(3) The disposition it received in its production;
(4) The mode and order of its production.

* Whether The Body Of The First Man Was Made Of The Slime Of The Earth?
* Whether The Human Body Was Immediately Produced By God?
* Whether The Body Of Man Was Given An Apt Disposition?
* Whether The Production Of The Human Body Is Fittingly Described In Scripture?
