# How The Human Soul Knows What Is Above Itself

We must now consider how the human soul knows what is above itself, viz. immaterial substances. Under this head there are three points of inquiry:
(1) Whether the human soul in the present state of life can understand the immaterial substances called angels, in themselves?
(2) Whether it can arrive at the knowledge thereof by the knowledge of material things?
(3) Whether God is the first object of our knowledge?

* Whether The Human Soul In The Present State Of Life Can Understand Immaterial Substances In Themselves?
* Whether Our Intellect Can Understand Immaterial Substances Through Its Knowledge Of Material Things?
* Whether God Is The First Object Known By The Human Mind?
