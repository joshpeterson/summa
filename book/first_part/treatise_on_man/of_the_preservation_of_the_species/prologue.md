# Of The Preservation Of The Species

We next consider what belongs to the preservation of the species; and, first, of generation; secondly, of the state of the offspring. Under the first head there are two points of inquiry:
(1) Whether in the state of innocence there would have been generation?
(2) Whether generation would have been through coition?

* Whether In The State Of Innocence There Would Have Been Generation By Coition?
