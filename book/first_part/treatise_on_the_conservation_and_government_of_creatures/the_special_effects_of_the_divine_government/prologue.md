We next consider the effects of the Divine government in particular; concerning which four points of inquiry arise:

(2) Whether they are immediately preserved by God?
(3) Whether God can reduce anything to nothingness?
(4) Whether anything is reduced to nothingness?

* Whether Creatures Need To Be Kept In Being By God?
* Whether God Preserves Every Creature Immediately?
* Whether God Can Annihilate Anything?
* Whether Anything Is Annihilated?
