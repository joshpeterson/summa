# The Speech Of The Angels

We next consider the speech of the angels. Here there are five points of inquiry:
(1) Whether one angel speaks to another?
(2) Whether the inferior speaks to the superior?
(3) Whether an angel speaks to God?
(4) Whether the angelic speech is subject to local distance?
(5) Whether all the speech of one angel to another is known to all?

* Whether One Angel Speaks To Another?
* Whether The Inferior Angel Speaks To The Superior?
* Whether An Angel Speaks To God?
* Whether Local Distance Influences The Angelic Speech?
* Whether All The Angels Know What One Speaks To Another?
