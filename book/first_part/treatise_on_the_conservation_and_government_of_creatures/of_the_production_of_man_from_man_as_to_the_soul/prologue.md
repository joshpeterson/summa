# Of The Production Of Man From Man As To The Soul

We next consider the production of man from man: first, as to the soul; secondly, as to the body.  Under the first head there are three points of inquiry:
(1) Whether the sensitive soul is transmitted with the semen?
(2) Whether the intellectual soul is thus transmitted?
(3) Whether all souls were created at the same time?

* Whether The Sensitive Soul Is Transmitted With The Semen?
* Whether The Intellectual Soul Is Produced From The Semen?
* Whether Human Souls Were Created Together At The Beginning Of The World?
