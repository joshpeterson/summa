# Of The Government Of Things In General

Having considered the creation of things and their distinction, we now consider in the third place the government thereof, and (1) the government of things in general; (2) in particular, the effects of this government. Under the first head there are eight points of inquiry:
(1) Whether the world is governed by someone?
(2) What is the end of this government?
(3) Whether the world is governed by one?
(4) Of the effects of this government?
(5) Whether all things are subject to Divine government?
(6) Whether all things are immediately governed by God?
(7) Whether the Divine government is frustrated in anything?
(8) Whether anything is contrary to the Divine Providence?

* Whether The World Is Governed By One?
* Whether The Effect Of Government Is One Or Many?
* Whether All Things Are Subject To The Divine Government?
* Whether All Things Are Immediately Governed By God?
