# The Mission Of The Angels

We next consider the mission of the angels. Under this head arise four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether any angels are sent on works of ministry?
(2) Whether all are sent?
(3) Whether those who are sent, assist?
(4) From what orders they are sent.

* Whether The Angels Are Sent On Works Of Ministry?
* Whether All The Angels Are Sent In Ministry?
* Whether All The Angels Who Are Sent, Assist?
* Whether All The Angels Of The Second Hierarchy Are Sent?
