# Of The Angelic Degrees Of Hierarchies And Orders

We next consider the degrees of the angels in their hierarchies and orders; for it was said above ([868]Q[106], A[3]), that the superior angels enlighten the inferior angels; and not conversely.  Under this head there are eight points of inquiry:
(1) Whether all the angels belong to one hierarchy?
(2) Whether in one hierarchy there is only one order?
(3) Whether in one order there are many angels?
(4) Whether the distinction of hierarchies and orders is natural?
(5) Of the names and properties of each order.
(6) Of the comparison of the orders to one another.
(7) Whether the orders will outlast the Day of Judgment?
(8) Whether men are taken up into the angelic orders?
