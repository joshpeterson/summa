# The Ordering Of The Bad Angels

We now consider the ordering of the bad angels; concerning which there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether there are orders among the demons?
(2) Whether among them there is precedence?
(3) Whether one enlightens another?
(4) Whether they are subject to the precedence of the good angels?

* Whether There Are Orders Among The Demons?
* Whether Among The Demons There Is Precedence?
* Whether There Is Enlightenment In The Demons?
* Whether The Good Angels Have Precedence Over The Bad Angels?
