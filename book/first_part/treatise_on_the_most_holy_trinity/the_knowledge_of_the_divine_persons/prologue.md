# The Knowledge Of The Divine Persons

We proceed to inquire concerning the knowledge of the divine persons; and this involves four points of inquiry:

(2) Whether notions are to be attributed to the divine persons?
(3) The number of the notions?
(4) Whether we may lawfully have various contrary opinions of these notions?
