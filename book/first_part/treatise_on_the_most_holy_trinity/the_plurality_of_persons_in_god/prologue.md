# The Plurality Of Persons In God

We are now led to consider the plurality of the persons: about which there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether there are several persons in God?
(2) How many are they?
(3) What the numeral terms signify in God?
(4) The community of the term "person."

* Whether There Are Several Persons In God?
* Whether There Are More Than Three Persons In God?
* Whether The Numeral Terms Denote Anything Real In God?
* Whether This Term "Person" Can Be Common To The Three Persons?
