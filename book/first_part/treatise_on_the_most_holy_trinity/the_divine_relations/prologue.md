# The Divine Relations

The divine relations are next to be considered, in four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether there are real relations in God?
(2) Whether those relations are the divine essence itself, or are extrinsic to it?
(3) Whether in God there can be several relations distinct from each other?
(4) The number of these relations.

* Whether There Are Real Relations In God?
* Whether Relation In God Is The Same As His Essence?
* Whether The Relations In God Are Really Distinguished From Each Other?
* Whether In God There Are Only Four Real Relations---paternity, Filiation, Spiration, And Procession?
