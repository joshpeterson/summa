# Of The Persons As Compared To The Relations Or Properties

We now consider the persons in connection with the relations, or properties; and there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether relation is the same as person?
(2) Whether the relations distinguish and constitute the persons?
(3) Whether mental abstraction of the relations from the persons leaves the hypostases distinct?
(4) Whether the relations, according to our mode of understanding, presuppose the acts of the persons, or contrariwise?

* Whether Relation Is The Same As Person?
* Whether The Persons Are Distinguished By The Relations?
* Whether The Hypostases Remain If The Relations Are Mentally Abstracted From The Persons?
* Whether The Properties Presuppose The Notional Acts?
