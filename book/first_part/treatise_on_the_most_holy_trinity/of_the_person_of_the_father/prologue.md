# Of The Person Of The Father

We now consider the persons singly; and first, the Person of the Father, concerning Whom there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether the Father is the Principle?
(2) Whether the person of the Father is properly signified by this name "Father"?
(3) Whether "Father" in God is said personally before it is said essentially?
(4) Whether it belongs to the Father alone to be unbegotten?

* Whether It Belongs To The Father To Be The Principle?
* Whether This Name "Father" Is Properly The Name Of A Divine Person?
* Whether This Name "Father" Is Applied To God, Firstly As A Personal Name?
* Whether It Is Proper To The Father To Be Unbegotten?
