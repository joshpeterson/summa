# Of Goodness In General

We next consider goodness: First, goodness in general. Secondly, the goodness of God.  Under the first head there are six points of inquiry:
(1) Whether goodness and being are the same really?
(2) Granted that they differ only in idea, which is prior in thought?
(3) Granted that being is prior, whether every being is good?
(4) To what cause should goodness be reduced?
(5) Whether goodness consists in mode, species, and order?
(6) Whether goodness is divided into the virtuous, the useful, and the pleasant?

* Whether Goodness Differs Really From Being?

* Whether Goodness Has The Aspect Of A Final Cause?
* Whether The Essence Of Goodness Consists In Mode, Species And Order?
* Whether Goodness Is Rightly Divided Into The Virtuous, The Useful And The Pleasant?
