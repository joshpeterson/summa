# Of Ideas

After considering the knowledge of God, it remains to consider ideas. And about this there are three points of inquiry:
(1) Whether there are ideas?
(2) Whether they are many, or one only?
(3) Whether there are ideas of all things known by God?

* Whether There Are Ideas?
* Whether Ideas Are Many?
* Whether There Are Ideas Of All Things That God Knows?
