# The Life Of God

Since to understand belongs to living beings, after considering the divine knowledge and intellect, we must consider the divine life. About this, four points of inquiry arise:
(1) To whom does it belong to live?
(2) What is life?
(3) Whether life is properly attributed to God?
(4) Whether all things in God are life?

* Whether To Live Belongs To All Natural Things?
* Whether Life Is An Operation?
* Whether Life Is Properly Attributed To God?
* Whether All Things Are Life In God?
