# The Existence Of God In Things

Since it evidently belongs to the infinite to be present everywhere, and in all things, we now consider whether this belongs to God; and concerning this there arise four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether God is in all things?
(2) Whether God is everywhere?
(3) Whether God is everywhere by essence, power, and presence?
(4) Whether to be everywhere belongs to God alone?

* Whether God Is In All Things?
* Whether God Is Everywhere?
* Whether God Is Everywhere By Essence, Presence And Power?
* Whether To Be Everywhere Belongs To God Alone?
