# The Infinity Of God

After considering the divine perfection we must consider the divine infinity, and God's existence in things: for God is everywhere, and in all things, inasmuch as He is boundless and infinite.  Concerning the first, there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether God is infinite?
(2) Whether anything besides Him is infinite in essence?
(3) Whether anything can be infinitude in magnitude?
(4) Whether an infinite multitude can exist?

* Whether God Is Infinite?
* Whether Anything But God Can Be Essentially Infinite?
* Whether An Actually Infinite Magnitude Can Exist?
