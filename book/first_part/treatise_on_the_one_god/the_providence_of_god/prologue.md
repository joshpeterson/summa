# The Providence Of God

Having considered all that relates to the will absolutely, we must now proceed to those things which have relation to both the intellect and the will, namely providence, in respect to all created things; predestination and reprobation and all that is connected with these acts in respect especially of man as regards his eternal salvation. For in the science of morals, after the moral virtues themselves, comes the consideration of prudence, to which providence would seem to belong. Concerning God's providence there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether providence is suitably assigned to God?
(2) Whether everything comes under divine providence?
(3) Whether divine providence is immediately concerned with all things?
(4) Whether divine providence imposes any necessity upon things foreseen?

* Whether Providence Can Suitably Be Attributed To God?
* Whether Everything Is Subject To The Providence Of God?
* Whether God Has Immediate Providence Over Everything?
* Whether Providence Imposes Any Necessity On Things Foreseen?
