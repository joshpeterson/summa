# The Unity Of God

After the foregoing, we consider the divine unity; concerning which there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether "one" adds anything to "being"?
(2) Whether "one" and "many" are opposed to each other?
(3) Whether God is one?
(4) Whether He is in the highest degree one?

* Whether "One" Adds Anything To "Being"?
* Whether "One" And "Many" Are Opposed To Each Other?
* Whether God Is One?
* Whether God Is Supremely One?
