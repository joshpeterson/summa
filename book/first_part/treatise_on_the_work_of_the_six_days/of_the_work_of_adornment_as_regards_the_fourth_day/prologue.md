# Of The Work Of Adornment, As Regards The Fourth Day

We must next consider the work of adornment, first as to each day by itself, secondly as to all seven days in general.  In the first place, then, we consider the work of the fourth day, secondly, that of the fifth day, thirdly, that of the sixth day, and fourthly, such matters as belong to the seventh day.  Under the first head there are three points of inquiry:
(1) As to the production of the lights;
(2) As to the end of their production;
(3) Whether they are living beings?

* Whether The Lights Ought To Have Been Produced On The Fourth Day?
* Whether The Cause Assigned For The Production Of The Lights Is Reasonable?
* Whether The Lights Of Heaven Are Living Beings?
