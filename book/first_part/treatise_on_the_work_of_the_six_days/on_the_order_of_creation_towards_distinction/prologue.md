# On The Order Of Creation Towards Distinction

We must next consider the work of distinction; first, the ordering of creation towards distinction; secondly, the distinction itself. Under the first head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether formlessness of created matter preceded in time its formation?
(2) Whether the matter of all corporeal things is the same?
(3) Whether the empyrean heaven was created contemporaneously with formless matter?
(4) Whether time was created simultaneously with it?

* Whether Formlessness Of Created Matter Preceded In Time Its Formation?
* Whether The Formless Matter Of All Corporeal Things Is The Same?
* Whether The Empyrean Heaven Was Created At The Same Time As Formless Matter?
* Whether Time Was Created Simultaneously With Formless Matter?
