# On All The Seven Days In Common

We next consider all the seven days in common: and there are three points of inquiry:
(1) As to the sufficiency of these days;
(2) Whether they are all one day, or more than one?
(3) As to certain modes of speaking which Scripture uses in narrating the works of the six days.

* Whether These Days Are Sufficiently Enumerated?
* Whether All These Days Are One Day?
* Whether Scripture Uses Suitable Words To Express The Work Of The Six Days?
