# On The Things That Belong To The Seventh Day

We must next consider the things that belong to the seventh day. Under this head there are three points of inquiry:
(1) About the completion of the works;
(2) About the resting of God;
(3) About the blessing and sanctifying of this day.

* Whether The Completion Of The Divine Works Ought To Be Ascribed To The Seventh Day?
* Whether God Rested On The Seventh Day From All His Work?
* Whether Blessing And Sanctifying Are Due To The Seventh Day?
