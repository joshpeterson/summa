# On The Work Of The Second Day

We must next consider the work of the second day. Under this head there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Whether the firmament was made on the second day?
(2) Whether there are waters above the firmament?
(3) Whether the firmament divides waters from waters?
(4) Whether there is more than one heaven?

* Whether The Firmament Was Made On The Second Day?
* Whether There Are Waters Above The Firmament?
* Whether The Firmament Divides Waters From Waters?
