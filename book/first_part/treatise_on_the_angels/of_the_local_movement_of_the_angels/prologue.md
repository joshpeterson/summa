# Of The Local Movement Of The Angels

We must next consider the local movement of the angels; under which heading there are three points of inquiry:
(1) Whether an angel can be moved locally.
(2) Whether in passing from place to place he passes through intervening space?
(3) Whether the angel's movement is in time or instantaneous?

* Whether An Angel Can Be Moved Locally?
* Whether An Angel Passes Through Intermediate Space?
* Whether The Movement Of An Angel Is Instantaneous?
