# Of The Love Or Dilection Of The Angels

The next subject for our consideration is that act of the will which is love or dilection; because every act of the appetitive faculty comes of love.  Under this heading there are five points of inquiry:
(1) Whether there is natural love in the angels?
(2) Whether there is in them love of choice?
(3) Whether the angel loves himself with natural love or with love of choice?
(4) Whether one angel loves another with natural love as he loves himself?
(5) Whether the angel loves God more than self with natural love?
