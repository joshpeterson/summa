# The Punishment Of The Demons

It now remains as a sequel to deal with the punishment of the demons; under which heading there are four points of inquiry:
(1) Of their darkness of intellect;
(2) Of their obstinacy of will;
(3) Of their grief;
(4) Of their place of punishment.

* Whether The Demons' Intellect Is Darkened By Privation Of The Knowledge Of All Truth?
* Whether The Will Of The Demons Is Obstinate In Evil?
* Whether There Is Sorrow In The Demons?
* Whether Our Atmosphere Is The Demons' Place Of Punishment?
